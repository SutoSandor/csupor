<h1>CULTURE-HISTORICAL COLLECTION OF ZOLTÁN MIHÁLY CSUPOR  SDB</h1><br>
<h1>1919-1995</h1><br><br>
  <p id="szoveg">

      In 1995 the Gödöllő Town Museum grew with a collection containing thousands of pieces, with the culture-historical collection of the parish-priest Zoltán Mihály Csupor of Tordas village.<br><br>
      Zoltán Csupor was born in Perenye in 1919 as the sixth child of a cantor-teacher. He first heard about the order of the Salesians at the State Secondary Grammar School in Kisvárda. The desire to teach and his dedication to pedagogy called Zoltan Csupor to the Salesians, since the order of St. John Bosco - after the Jesuits - is the second largest teaching order in the world. As a priest teacher he did a good and successful job. In 1950, however, the religious orders were broken up in Hungary. Contrary to the majority of the other members of his order, he was allowed to remain a priest. <br><br>
      In 1954 he went to Tordas, which was mainly inhabited by Lutherans, the smallest and the poorest parish of the Székesfehérvár diocese. Zoltán Csupor found a way to teach, faithful to his Salesian oath, in the hopeless, futureless situation and despite the inhibitory circumstances. He called a collection to life, whose pieces he regarded as the realia of education. <br><br>
      He started his collecting work with the Sajnovics research. János Sajnovics (1733-1785) a great son of Tordas was a Jesuit linguist and astronomer, who became a pioneer of modern linguistics with his book on the linguistic relationship between Lappish and Hungarian. Zoltán Csupor's collecting and research work was initially connected to Sajnovics's activity: he built a first-class meteorological station, purchased astronomical binoculars and obtained an extremely valuable map collection. Later his research work continued to grow further and wider, and one subject attracted another. Finally, his passion for collecting took him to areas independent of the activities of Sajnovics, he increased the collection with objects of technical history, applied arts, textiles, archives, ethnography, etc. <br><br>
      Due to the objects of dualism and relics of Queen Elisabeth he came into contact with Gödöllő, and he entered into an annuity contract with the town on 27 October, 1987, which meant that after his death the Gödöllő Town Museum would receive his collection. On 24 July 1994 an exhibition of the Csupor Collection was organized by the Gödöllő Town Museum in Gödöllő. On 20 August, 1995 Tordas awarded the title of honorary citizen to his priest, who soon after that died on 29 November, 1995 at the age of 76. His culture-historical collection of thousands of pieces was taken to Gödöllő Town Museum, where the most representative pieces of the collection were exhibited in a separate room. <br><br>
