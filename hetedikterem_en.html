  <h1>Restoration of Painted Decorative Tinware - an Aquarium Integrated with a Cage</h1><br>
  <p id="szoveg">

<b>Csilla Cserepkei</b><br><br>

My job was the restoration of a 19th century, eclectic room ornament made by a tinsmith (Figures 1-4). Due to the inadequate storage the multilayer decorative painting on the corroded and defective baseplate also suffered damage.<br><br>
The subject of the thesis is to eliminate the traces of contamination and corrosion, to prevent the further corrosion of the metal, to replace it with the original technique and to supplement-preserve the paint layers so that the object can be placed in its due place, an exhibition.<br><br>
<b>Details of the object </b><br><br>
Owner: Gödöllő Town Museum<br><br>
Marking: unmarked<br><br>
The former owner of the object, Zoltán Mihály Csupor (1919-1995) is a Salesian priest, a pastor from Tordas, an amateur art collector, whose notes state that the four-piece cage-aquarium had been made by a tinsmith for the Millennium Exhibition of 1896. Unfortunately, we could not find out the name of the master during the research, and looking through the literature of the Millennium Exhibition of 1896 we did not find any written or photographic traces of the object.  <br><br>
<b>Dimensions:</b> overall height: 177.5 cm of which the height of the elements: - stand: 78.5 cm, aquarium: 51.5 cm, intermediate element: 11.5 cm, cage: 48.5 cm. Total area: 52x44 cm.<br><br>
<b>Materials:</b> painted tin (tinned iron), brass plate, zinc cast and plate, wood and clay slate. <br><br>
<b>Description of the object</b><br><br>
This architectural-type, eclectic object was made of the mentioned materials by a tinsmith with the technique known from his job, mainly made of pressed plate, applying riveting and soft soldering. The bigger part of the object is made of tin, but some of its parts, especially those in contact with water, are made of zinc plates, such as the water tank and the bottom plate of the pool as well as the base.<br><br>
In addition to exhibiting the treasury of craftsmanship, this room decoration also had a function: keeping pets and holding a potted plant in the ring of the stand. In addition, due to the careful design, there is another attraction hidden in the aquarium: the pool could also be operated as a fountain with water running down from the water tank covered with the intermediate element. One of the columns provided the connection between the water tank and the pipeline connecting the pool, and in the aquarium in the middle the water sprinkled out of the nozzle sticking out of the water. On the difficult-to-move object even water replacement was managed with a drain plug.<br><br>
During the study of the decorative painting on the cage-aquarium several different layers were discovered: under the peeling on the surface of the object we found a decoration with totally different colours and patterns from today’s decoration. Under the top, bluish-grey compilation combined with bronze, black and brown there is a more subtle, light yellowish, green paint layer where some parts were highlighted with gold. Underneath the bottom paint there is a red primer on the metal everywhere except for the cage. The top element of the object probably did not get a primer due to its function since it did not have to be waterproof so the tin coating of the iron could have been considered sufficient protection.<br><br>
When the paint layers were surveyed, a monogram became visible on the door of the cage: H. A. and a year: 1894, which partially supports the information on the origin of the object.<br><br>
<b>Condition assessment</b><br><br>
There was a lot of contamination and damage on the cage-aquarium which could have resulted from improper storage and usage. On each part of the object in addition to dusty contamination there were rust stains and mechanical damage - paint peeling, deformations, missing structural elements or decorations. Furthermore, traces of previous repairs had worsened the overall picture of the object.<br><br>
The main damage to the stand beside the one mentioned above is that one foot was broken at the rivet fastening it to the connecting ring. Here there were traces of a repair attempt: the surface of the ring had been burnt. The entire stand was slightly deformed, which could have been caused by the fact the cage aquarium was stored assembled even after the foot was damaged.<br><br>
The aquarium was also rusty and damaged in many places, and there was a trace of subsequent repair on the bottom: they had attempted to operate the fountain with an aluminium pipe painted white and fixed with a kit. In addition, three of the side glasses of the pool were broken and their colours were different. <br><br>
The intermediate element is in good condition, its paint layers are intact on a large area, the metal was corroded only on one side. <br><br>
On the cage the hinges of the "entrance door" and the gutter showed signs of previous repair, but the soft solder did not hold any longer. The slate sheets hammered on the roof wood were only dusty and stained with moisture. The profiled cap of the roof was distorted and rusty at several places, and the repair soldering was also improper. Where the roof planes meet there is a flange of paint and solder visible in the centre, which suggests that there was some additional decoration on the top of the little house, which is no longer there. This may have been a chimney, or rather a small tower may have crowned the building, but it is only a guess without data.<br><br>
<b>Material tests</b><br><br>
After the visual inspection phototechnical testing was carried out on the cage-aquarium. Under the effect of UV radiation the lower painted surface appearing underneath the peeling layers became more contrasted due to the stronger luminescence of the zinc white pigment, and the uneven varnish became quite conspicuous (Figure 5-6). <br><br>
Dissolution tests were carried out to identify and remove the contaminants and varnish on the cage aquarium. The test was started with weaker solvents (water) and we moved toward the stronger ones. During the test the paint layers of the object did not prove water-sensitive, and the most effective mixture of chemicals based on its Teas triangular graph point could be a natural resin (eg dammar or colophony) and oil mixture of the varnish. <br><br>
The polarization microscope was used for powder samples (scrape sample) and microscopic cross-section grindings embedded in resin. <br><br>
The pigments found in the powder sample taken from the paint layer were determined according to their morphology and optical behaviour by Éva Galambos via testing in transmitted light. The paint layers on the cage-aquarium are characterized by their uniform quality and they generally consist of a mixture of micron-sized pigments, i.e. the materials used for decorative painting are most likely "industrial" pre-mixed paints. <br><br>
Under illumination from above the repaintings of the object became visible on the microscopic cross-section grindings taken from the cage aquarium (Figure 7). Basically, two successive periods can be distinguished based on the patterns in the decorative painting of the object covering the entire surface. Later some parts were highlighted by brass colour , then a varnish layer was applied on some highlighted sides, and finally some details were splashed with bronze paint. This massive object was rarely moved - this is indicated by the fact that only the reachable half of the object was varnished, which was accessible, and its part turned to the wall was varnished only at a few places or not at all. <br><br>
X-ray fluorescence spectrometry was used to determine the basic materials of the object with the help of Zoltán May. As a result of the test without sampling, tin-plated iron and zinc plates were determined as the raw material of the object, and the gold glittering parts of the decorative painting contain copper, precious metal, and in several places the results of the pigment test were confirmed. <br><br>
The microscopic cross-section grinding originating from the roof cap of the cage was examined by dr. Attila Tóth, physicist of the Institute of Technical Physical and Material Science of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA) with electron-beam microanalysis. On the basis of the completed element map, copper enrichment was evident in the bronze powder layer and in the lower pale yellow paint there was a lot of Zn besides Ba, Ca and Pb. <br><br>
The results of the material tests are summarized in Table 1. <br><br>
<b>Restoration</b><br><br>
<b>Wet cleaning</b><br><br>
The cage aquarium was covered with large amounts of dust and contamination of human origin. The loose surface contamination was swept away with a brush, and since the paint layers did not prove to be water-sensitive during the dissolution tests, the more strongly bound, dusty, slightly greasy contamination on the object was removed with the foam of 1% distilled water solution of Solovet  with a brush and technical brush (Fig. 8). <br><br>
The object was cleaned from top to bottom with relatively rapid movements, and immediately rinsed with a brush and distilled water and then the residual moisture was blotted with artificial cotton and clean linen fabric. Subsequently, the object was placed in a well-ventilated place to dry.<br><br>
<b> Chemical cleaning</b><br><br>
The varnish on the cage aquarium became darker during its aging and more and more covered the layers below it, so we decided to remove it.<br><br>
The article by András Morgós  includes the result of the research by Masschlein and Kleiner in 1981, which suggests different solvent mixtures for different types of layers to be removed . According to the table first the chemicals recommended for the removal of thinner varnish layers (solvents 6 to 9) were tested, and then, as this did not bring results, solvents suitable for removing thicker varnish (10-14) were tested. Among them the best was No. 13, which was a mixture of 75% toluol and 25% dimethylformamide and based on its Teas triangular graph dissolution point it is suitable for dissolving waxes, resins and oils too. <br><br>
On the dark layer there were debris, filaments and other contamination stuck almost everywhere. This could have been caused by the fact that the surface had not been dusted before painting, and the varnish presumably consisting of a mixture of oil and resin could have dried slowly, during which it was difficult to protect it from contamination. <br><br>
The solvent was applied to the area to be cleaned using cotton wool twisted on a bamboo stick and then the loose, swollen varnish was removed with rolling movements (Figure 9). The lively colours of the top ink layer appeared on the clean surface (Figure 10-11).<br><br>
<b>Removing corrosion</b><br><br>
The aluminium tube at the bottom of the aquarium together with the putty used for repair was removed with a spatula. 
In order to clean the interior of the cage, it was necessary to remove the top of the roof. The joints were warmed up with a soldering iron and the desired part was removed (Figure 12). <br><br>
When removing the rust the angle grinder could not be used in difficult to reach places, so we used an abrasive blasting unit with 0.10 mm glass beads , with a small nozzle at the recommendation of Gábor Séd (before and after blasting: Figure 13). <br><br>
The meticulous method did not damage the iron and its tin coating. <br><br>
The glass surfaces were masked with PE foil because the beads could make the surfaces matt.<br><br>
<b>Removing the top paint layer</b><br><br>
The bluish-greyish decorative painting was of lower quality than the layer underneath, which would not have been fortunate to be covered with putty or primer to preserve the top paint layer along with the year that verifies the age of the object. After consultation with the owner of the object we decided to remove it.<br><br>
No suitable solvent was found to separate the two layers, so we used a scalpel to gently peel off the paint to be removed (Figure 14).<br><br>
The slate on the cage proved to be vulnerable, therefore we could not work with the blade, so dissolving with Super Chromophagus  (a paint stripper) was chosen - it proved to be the most effective that did not damage the mineral. <br><br>
During the dissolution, it turned out that the slate tiles were of different colours and that there was no regularity in the layout of the plates (Figure 15). This led to the conclusion that when the artist was covering the roof he did not arrange the tiles according to a pattern because he wanted to paint them. Based on this, there may have been two paint layers on the roof too, despite the results of the completed microscopic cross-section grindings and explorations. While exploring the remaining painted surface microscopically my consultant found very fragmented and thin, dark grey and brown paint layers under the top layer. A mixture of dichloroethane and methanol (1: 1) was used for the exploration, slowing down the process by wiping with white spirit.  <br><br>
 <b>Restoration of the decorations of the object</b><br><br>
The cage-aquarium was deformed in several places and some elements were defective. The cap of the cage made of profiled sheet was in the worst condition, the excess soft solder was removed from the cap with a solder iron to make it possible to smooth out the deformed metal. The deformations were smoothened with wooden shapes and with a mallet on metal support. <br><br>
The fixing was done in many places according to the original by soft soldering (Figure 16), but on some parts where it was not possible or necessary because of the paint layer (no static role), gluing was applied. <br><br>
The surfaces to be joined were cleaned with fine grinding wheels or rubber discs down to the metal, and tinner’s fluid i.e., a zinc chloride solution and soldering paste was used as a flux for the soldering. The excess solder was removed with milling heads and rubber discs and the object was wiped with distilled water to remove the chlorides from the fluxes.<br><br>
For the supplements of missing parts the cut out elements of 0.5 mm soft steel embossed with chasing were fixed in their place by soft soldering. In some places supporting parts were made from thinner steel sheets such as under the edge soldering of the roof sheets or on the back of broken ornaments where the applied solder would not have provided adequate support.<br><br>
The adhesive material was Araldite Rapid two-component epoxy resin. The same fixing was used to re-attach the door or the restored roof sheets. For the sake of stability, the roof was glued to 0.5 mm thick steel plate tabs (Figure 17).<br><br>
<b>Passivation, protection</b><br><br>
The passivation of the cage-aquarium was carried out with a mixture of 10% alcohol and Ferropassit , a preparation containing phosphoric acid. The solution was applied on the entire surface by a brush, also on the original paint layers, because the liquid could have penetrated through the cracks and had its effect on the iron surface. After the treating agent had dried, the object was wiped with distilled water, which removed possible residual acids and surface whitening.<br><br>
After drying the whole object was protected with Paraloid B67 10% in white spirit.<br><br>
<b>Priming, retouching</b><br><br>
The unpainted parts of the cage-aquarium were covered with primer with a brush to smooth out the holes created due to paint peeling (Fig. 18-19). The selected preparation was Policolor anti-corrosion primer, which is soluble in white spirit, can be coloured with earth pigment dye, adapts well to the surface of the object, and due to its zinc content prevents rusting of the base metal. The matching retouching was prepared on this matte base from a denser (12-15%) Paraloid B67 solution slightly coloured with oil paint, which made the surface a little more glittery. <br><br>
Due to the bad state of the original paint layer on the slate cover of the roof the addition can not be made authentically. Based on the remaining traces, most of the slate tiles had brown painting on (many times even under the dark grey), so we painted the tiles a similar, uniform brown colour. The retouching was done with watercolour and then a solution of Paraloid B67 10% and white spirit was applied as a protective coating.<br><br>
Restored aquarium-cage: Figures 20-23<br><br>

The cage-aquarium is an ornament in which pets and even ornamental plants could have been kept. Therefore during the restoration the idea of making it usable again was raised, by which the object could have been a spectacle in the exhibition. This did not materialize, primarily in view of the historical value of the object. In addition to the fact that the presence of animals and the presence of moisture associated with the aquarium is not recommended in an exhibition, they would have been a source of additional danger to the object. Making the aquarium waterproof and reconstructing the fountain would have caused irreversible damage to the object. <br><br>

The restoration of the object took place in the 2010/2011 school year in the framework of the applied arts restorer training organized through the cooperation of the Hungarian University of Fine Arts and the Hungarian National Museum. The thesis supervisor was Eszter Szatmáriné Bakonyi, the consultant was Petronella Kovács, DLA.                                                       <br><br>

<b>Summary</b><br><br>
The aquarium, which is located on a stand, integrated with a cage, belonging to the Csupor Collection of the Gödöllő Town Museum, was built by a tinsmith in 1894. <br><br>
The material of the painted tinplate was rusty in many places, its multilayer decorative painting was peeling, in addition, deformations and deficiencies worsened the appearance and stability of the object. <br><br>
The purpose of the restoration was to prevent further damage to the artwork and to make it exhibitable.<br><br>
The darkened, aged varnish layer and the worse top paint layer had to be removed from the cage-aquarium to bring the lower, more decorative painting to the surface, on which the year and a monogram also became visible.<br><br>
The traces of the previous, incorrect repairs (burned decorative painting, unnecessary solder lumps) were removed. During the removal of the subsequent soldering of the roof we reached the inside of the cage.<br><br>
The rust on the object was cleaned with an abrasive blasting unit, and then the surface was passivated with an inhibitory phosphoric acid solution. The deformations were smoothened with wooden shapes, a steel hammer and a mallet. The supplements of missing parts were made of steel sheet and fixed by epoxy resin bonding or soft soldering. For reinforcement purposes thin steel plate supporting was soldered on the cap of the cage roof and on some decorations. <br><br>
The top paint layer was removed mechanically or with solvent, thus revealing the original painting of the object of the time. After this the entire surface of the cage-aquarium was treated with a solution of Paraloid B67 and white spirit for protection.<br><br>
To supplement the decorative painting, a zinc primer coloured with earth pigment dyes was applied, which filled the holes properly. During the retouching a slightly denser solution of Paraloid B67 was used for the protection mixed with a small amount of oil paint to achieve the proper colour tone. The restoration of the paint on the slate cover was done with watercolour, which also received Paraloid B67 coating.<br><br>
During the restoration work, the extensive and complicated surface of the object and its complex raw material posed a difficulty, and so did the multilayer, decorative painting, which required great attention. With this instructive restoration a special object can be placed in an exhibition again for the pleasure of visitors. <br><br>
